        <h1>About Wind Storm</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            A storm marked by high wind with little or no precipitation. Windstorm damage often opens the door for massive amounts of water and debris to cause further damage to a structure.
            Strong winds from any storm type can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles.
            
           
        <br><br>
        In the United States, major hurricanes comprise just 21% of all landfalling tropical cyclones, but account for 83% of all damage. Tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people, preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts.

         <br><br>
         Tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges, overpasses, and roads, complicating efforts to transport food, clean water, and medicine to the areas that need it. Furthermore, the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region, and to a diaspora of the population of the region.

        <h1>DOs and Don'ts</h1>
        <br>
        <p>  Postpone outdoor activities if a wind advisory or high wind warning has been issued.
            Shutter windows securely and brace outside doors. Take cover next to a building or under a shelter.
        <br><br>
        
         Bring in unsecured objects from patios and balconies and secure outdoor objects such as lawn furniture or garbage cans that  could blow away and cause damage or injury.Contact local officials, state geological surveys or departments of natural resources,   and university departments of geology
         <br><br>

         Watch for flying debris. Tree limbs may break and street signs may become loose during strong wind gusts. Keep an eye toward nearby balconies for loose objects that may fall
